            Caroline Mugo
My name is Caroline Mugo , I am a law student  at Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (Karen campus). For my legal aid attachment, I was privileged to get an opportunity at Action for children in confict (AfCiC). I was given the opportunity to be involved with website and social media pages in a hands-on manner, which was very educational, and I surely did learn an authentic amount of web development, photography and editting and legal research knowledge from my time there. I also had the opportunity to work with the social workers where I got the opportunity to do street work.There is absolutely nothing as great as volunteering in at AfCiC. I was touched by the warm hearts and selflesness of the organisation, and I was given a chance to give back to the world in a meaningful way.The friends made at AfCiC will surely last me a life time, and the experience has truly changed my life for the better. Anyone looking to make a difference in the world, help out a needy neighbor, and make some great memories should definitely join AfCiC. Through volunteering in AfCiC, with the most underprivileged children you may ever be exposed to, will definitely give you the maturity, integrity, motivation and passion to mold you into a better person.
