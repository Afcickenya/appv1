            I am Eric Maina, an ICT Professional, I joined AfCiC  in the Year 2021 as an intern, I was impressed by the good deeds of humanity done by the organization and learnt that for you he help a needy you don’t have to be a millionaire but just assisting someone to the best of your capacity is more better off. In the era that we are living money is not always the problem with most of the people, some need someone to listen to or to get advice them, as it is said Humanity to people is service to God. This has also helped me in widening my thinking and ideology in approaching different situations/ matters away from my area of profession. “Be the reason someone smile. Be the reason someone feels loved and believes in the goodness of people.”
