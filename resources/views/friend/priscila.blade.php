            I am Priscilla Mumbi a specialist in Public health.
            Being in a revolutionary world mankind is likely to be curbed with emerging and re-emerging health problems. AfCiC is aware of this and has offered opportunities to young people who are willing to expand their knowledge and expertise on issues pertaining human health. My stay in AfCiC has created an opportunity to be in a team centered environment and learn from co- workers who have the same goals as mine.
            I have participated in planning, monitoring and evaluation of programmes such as School Nutrition programme, Adolescent and teenage mothers program, as well as School health clubs which has developed me career wise.
            My research skills, report writing and proposal preparation skills have been nurtured too. I have been able to use my skills outside my  area of specialization and gained experience doing a variety of tasks ranging from social work duties to office management .Most important I have  gained a strong interest in  health education ,guidance and counseling and have learnt that to achieve the SDG on health ,Gender equality ,Climate action everyone have to own up their responsibility .
