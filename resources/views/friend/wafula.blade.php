My name is Phostine Naliaka  Wafula. I studied bachelor of development studies at Mount Kenya University.

I volunteered at action for children in conflict for three months as a development studies expert which enabled me to gain a lot of skills related to my course.i worked at the outreach program for vulnerable children, majengo where I dealt with street children. Our main goal was to promote health, protection and development of children.  I enjoyed working with street children who visited our centre since through interaction with them; I was able to understand much about the lives of these street children and the problems they go through.

I helped the children in improving their sanitation , health and development in many sectors by doing both formal and non formal teachings to them. I empowered them with skills in different fields, that is, health education and promotion, gender, children rights, basic literacy skills, sex education and drug abuse. Through these sessions, children were able to know their rights since I realized that most of them were ignorant about them. Health education and drug abuse sessions helped the children improve their health as most of the children had been affected negatively due to abuse of drugs. It was my pleasure to work with these children as I helped them improve and develop their lives.
