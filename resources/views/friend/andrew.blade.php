            My name is Andrew Mwangi an accountant and an auditor. I joined AfCiC in August 2021 as a finance intern. I was impressed by how AfCiC was working hard in ensuring there was a world of equal and sustainable opportunities for children.
            All through I have learnt a lot by interacting with children and everyone who is involved in sustainability of these children.Â 
            Through AfCiC aim now able to apply critical thinking skills and also helped me to act in a way of values and principles.
