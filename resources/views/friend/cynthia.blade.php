My name is Cynthia i am a  Gender and Development studies graduate from Kenyatta University. I worked as a project management intern at Action for Children in Conflict.The youth who are our future leaders need support and a platform to showcase what they can do best in order to be effective agents of change in our society.During my internship  my colleagues were nothing but supportive and ready to help in different capacities. AFCIC  provided a learning environment where i grew intellectually and through various interactions and networking,it  transformed  my thinking into what i can do differently in order to empower my fellow youths in the community.
