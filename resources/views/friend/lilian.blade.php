            My name is Lillian Atieno, a volunteer at AFCIC and a strong believer of the saying, "the best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others." I am a development studies degree holder and I enjoy using my skills to create a strong and diverse community that is happier, healthier and richer. Our organization is aimed at creating an equal and sustainable community for the every child and the vulnerable. I utilize my expertise in developing strategies to help reduce poverty by participating in a teenage mother's program aimed at offering young mother's economic and educational empowerment. I am a teacher and motivator passionate about helping others be educated and inspired to work hard in order to achieve unliminent success.
