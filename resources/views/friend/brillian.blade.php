My name is Brillian Njoki, I am a Law student at Kenyatta University Parklands Campus. In AFCIC I worked as a legal intern- providing free legal advice to parents and children and advocating for their rights and fair treatment. The Kenya Children’s Legal Aid Work (KCLAW) is one of the specific programs in AFCIC that addresses issues around the safeguarding of the rights of children through the Kenyan legal system. . KCLAW receives complaints from clients who either come by themselves or are referred to us by the various Sub-County offices, mainly in Kiambu and Murang’a counties. The department receives complaints on a variety of issues concerning children but the dominant issues are custody and maintenance. In trying to solve this issues there are various approaches that we follow which are:

Mediation
Institute court proceedings on behalf of the minors
Offer legal advice to parents of the children
Watching brief in court matters involving children
Conduct awareness campaigns and outreach programs
Conduct training and capacity building
Advocacy and policy formulation
My stay at AFCIC has been rewarding, the organization has allowed me to better my career as well as my life in general. As a young girl I have acquired skills that advocate for young people to achieve their full potential and share their future with power and confidence. Healthy, productive and productive citizens.
