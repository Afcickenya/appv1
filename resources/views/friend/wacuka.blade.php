As a young budding Advocate of the High Court of Kenya, AFCIC has offered me numerous platforms to work with them in achieving their vision and mission of ensuring a sustainable environment for vulnerable children. This has been through conducting pro-Bono cases, participating in the drafting and enforcement of legal policies which affect children at the County and National level and contributing to various projects and field work by offering free legal advice to vulnerable families in the society. This has enabled me to also me to achieve my career goals due to the excellent exposure I get while working with them.
