My name is Diana Kemunto, a Teacher, social worker and a mentor. I joined Action for Children in Conflict in the year 2021. I was quite impressed by the organizations impact on the community. All through my time at AfCiC I have had the chance to serve and work with individuals, families and groups assessing their situations, capabilities and problems to determine the services required to meet their needs. I have worked with the street children and the street connected families which has really impacted me and helped me understand them better, currently I am working with the Adolescent girls and the street teenage mothers. The program has impacted the young girls and enhanced their growth, maturity and development. It has boosted their self esteem and confidence. Through the program we are able to address the risks they face as young girls. Action for Children in conflict has partnered with various primary schools to through Clubs to actively educate, motivate and mentor pupils in interactive ways on topics such as Child Rights and protection, Gender Equality, climate change and Reproductive Health and Growth. Giving me an opportunity to interact with the children and be determined to stimulate the pupilâ€™s creativity using friendly artistic activities which has helped in the psychological well-being of the children.
