                    <p>
                        Develop and support community development projects. 

                        Consolidate all forms of reconciliation and peace-building activities in order to promote constructive opportunities for Thika and more generally for Kenya. 
                        
                        Strengthen the capacities of local communities so that, despite the social context being vulnerable and fragile, they are able to carry out projects aimed at improving environmental degradation.
                        
                        Support political advocacy actions to develop changes in established practices and mentalities.
